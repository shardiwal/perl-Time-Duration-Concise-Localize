=head1 NAME

Time::Duration::Concise::Localize - An interesting approach to localize concise time duration string representation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Time::Duration::Concise is an approach to localize concise time duration string representation.

=head1 VERSION

Version 1.4

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Time::Duration::Concise::Localize;

    my $duration = Time::Duration::Concise::Localize->new(

        # concise time interval
        'interval' => '1.5h',

        # Localize class will be imported during runtime
        'localize_class' => 'My::i18n',

        # Your anonymous method, :) your logic for translation
        'localize_method' => sub {

            # This is an anonymous function, it would be called
            # when as_strig function generate duration as string
            # Your translation logic applies here

            My::i18n->new( 'language' => 'ms-my' )->translate_time_duration(@_);
            # Method translate_time_duration will recieve two parameters
            # value and unit
        }
    );

    $duration->as_string;

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 interval (REQUIRED)

concise interval string

=head2 localize_class (REQUIRED)

your custom localization class name

=cut

sub localize_class {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'_localize_class'};
}

=head2 localize_method (REQUIRED)

your custom localization anonymous method call

default paramenters to your class methods would be $val, $unit

=cut

sub localize_method {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'_localize_method'};
}

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_string

Localized duration string

=cut

    my $localize_class  = $self->localize_class;
    my $localize_method = $self->localize_method;

    die 'Failed to import localize class: ' if $@;

    my @duration_translated;
    foreach my $duration ( @{ $self->duration_array($precision) } ) {

        push( @duration_translated, $translated_interval );
    }

}

=head2 new

Object constructor

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my %params_ref = ref( $_[0] ) ? %{ $_[0] } : @_;

    my $interval = $params_ref{'interval'};

    confess "Missing required arguments"
      unless $params_ref{'localize_class'} and $params_ref{'localize_method'};

    my $self = $class->SUPER::new( interval => $interval );
    $self->{'_localize_class'}  = $params_ref{'localize_class'};
    $self->{'_localize_method'} = $params_ref{'localize_method'};

    my $obj = bless $self, $class;
